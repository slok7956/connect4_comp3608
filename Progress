I packaged all the alpha-beta pruning into a function, so it should be compatible with new versions of the minimax program, 
as long as it includes the global variable definitions, function definition, & function call.
Consistenly passing 7 tests, expanding too many nodes

Current version on Grok is not backed up to Github. Still consistently passing the same 7 tests, is now both over-expanding
and under-expanding branches. Reason probably issue with tracking alpha & beta values within a path & not including values
from previous paths: next step storing alpha & beta variables with current path
