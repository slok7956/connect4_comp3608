Handling timeouts:
Use iterative-depth style search: call connect_four_ab on loop, increasing the max depth and overwriting the last result until the end of the turn

  Using threading to send an interrupt (https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html#event-objects)
  Check whether a flat amount of time (eg 0.1 seconds) remains before starting another iteration; if not, return current value

Possible edits
  recurse
  Replace manual loop (i 1-7) with a dictionary
  Threading: when expanding a new node, give the call to recurse() to a new thread
  
  evaluation
  Change weighting: increase weighting based on how many in a row (4 or more highest, 1 lowest)
                    increase weighting for MAX relative to MIN
